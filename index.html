                <p>Individual mental health therapy sessions (sometimes we also call it mental health counseling) are an
                    essential opportunity to process through issues that tend to isolate us. Whether it is a mood
                    disorder, addiction, relationship challenges, trauma, or some other issue keeping you from living
                    your life in a fulfilled way, we will work together to get rid of it.</p>

                <h3>Couples Therapy</h3>
                <p>People in relationships seek counseling for various reasons, from power struggles and communication
                    problems to cheating. We'll effectively deal with trust and physical issues, conflict, financial
                    issues, and any other side effect impacting your relationship. We will work together to teach you
                    how to regulate your emotions and use healthy communication skills to resolve past and current
                    problems.</p>

                    participates in therapy. In order to encourage talks that create a pleasant environment and healthy
                    interactions going ahead, I work with others to better understand the dynamics, patterns, and

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Mental health refers to your overall psychological well-being. It includes your emotions,
                            thoughts, and behaviors, and can affect how you cope with stress, make decisions, and
                            interact

                        <p>Some common mental health disorders include anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder,
                            schizophrenia, and eating disorders. These disorders can cause significant distress and
                            impair
                            your ability to function in daily life.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Some ways to improve your mental health include practicing good self-care, such as getting
                            enough
                            sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly. It can also be helpful to talk to a
                            mental health professional, practice mindfulness, and build supportive relationships.</p>

                <h3>Do I really need therapy to get into good mental health?</h2>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>This is a very common question asked by my clients. But it’s not easy to answer. Therapy is a
                            process of personal growth and can be used to help you with any kind of mental or emotional
                            issue you have. If you have a specific emotional issue, relationship issues, or just feeling
                            down, counseling can help uplift your spirits and enhance your quality of life. When you are
                            ready to change and improve the overall quality of your life, that's when therapy can help
                            you.

            <section class="question">
                <h3>My partner, friend, or family member really needs therapy. Can I refer someone for counseling?</h2>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>You may be very concerned about someone's well-being and would like to see them have
                            counselling.
                            While it is best if the person in question reaches out for support themselves, we are able
                            to
                            take enquiries from you on behalf of someone else, but you should have their full consent.

                <h3>Is confidentiality guaranteed?</h2>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, everything you say is confidential, and I have taken auth to protect your privacy during
                            counseling sessions. You can ask me
                            questions before the therapy session begins if you have concerns about the confidentiality
                            of
                            the process. But there are some exceptions to the rule of confidentiality. The therapist
                            must
                            report as needed by law: threats of harm to oneself, threats of harm to others, suspected
                            child
                            or elder abuse – if the client is the victim or perpetrator.</p>

                <h3>What determines the success of therapy?</h2>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The answer is simple and short – YOU. Therapy is a personal step that helps many clients
                            along
                            the way. Your success depends on how open and honest you are to the process, as well as to
                            the
                            therapist. If you are willing to take the time to look within and do the work necessary for
                            change, you will be successful.</p>
